Test real world use cases, which will likely find design weaknesses.

Consider implementing other kinds of pipes (e.g. client/server).

Consider making this class Reflexive. What would I have to gain? Most likely
adding more advanced pipes will increase the need for event passing.

Determine how this pattern can be used with Reflexive::Workerpool. I should
just be able to create an object that extends Pipeline and consumes
Reflexive::WorkerPool::Role::Job then send that object to the workerpool.
